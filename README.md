abstract = {Container-based applications are increasingly favored for their efficiency in software development, deployment, and operation across various platforms. However, the growing number of security and privacy attacks poses significant concerns. Exploiting vulnerabilities within containers may compromise the entire host system, as both share the same operating system. Unfortunately, container defense mechanisms are inadequate due to the ever-evolving and dynamic attack landscape. In this paper, we systematize container attacks and defense mechanisms. We systematically analyze the effectiveness of (i) static container scanning tools proposed for vulnerability detection and reveal their shortcomings, as well as (ii) existing run-time anomaly-based detection approaches. We then establish an evaluation framework and comprehensively re-evaluate cutting-edge anomaly detection techniques tailored for containers using an extensive dataset of 51 real-world vulnerabilities. We emphasize that existing defenses are ineffective in protecting containers against state-of-the-art attacks. While anomaly detection-based approaches show potential in addressing dynamic attack landscapes, their high false positive rates and limited training data hinder practicality. Therefore, our work highlights the urgent need for further research to enhance the security of container-based applications.},
